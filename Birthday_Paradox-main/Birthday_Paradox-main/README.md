# Birthday_Paradox
This is a little GUI experiment about the Birthday Paradox. I mean really. This is experiment to prove birthday paradox. You know the BirthdayParadox right? 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem).
This is my little experiment but little bit different. I measure probability of being born on the same day of the week with
2-3-5-10-20 people. When you click the 'Devam Et!' button experiment starts. There is 7 box for 7 days of week. When you click the
button random number generate between 1-7 and put 'X' in the boxes corresponding to the number.For To be easy to examine, this experiment is manual.
So you can control the speed of experiment.
